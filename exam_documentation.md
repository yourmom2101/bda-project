## Model Interpretability

### SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)
SHAP values provide a unified measure of feature importance that shows how each feature contributes to the model's predictions.

#### SHAP Summary Plot (`shap_summary.png`)
- Shows the overall importance of each feature
- Features are ordered by their impact on predictions
- Red indicates higher feature values, blue indicates lower values
- The width of each feature's impact shows its importance
- Helps identify which features have the most influence on predictions

#### SHAP Dependence Plots (`shap_dependence_[feature].png`)
- Shows how each top feature affects predictions
- Reveals non-linear relationships between features and predictions
- Helps understand feature interactions
- Shows the distribution of feature values
- Useful for identifying potential feature thresholds

### LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations)
LIME provides local explanations for individual predictions, making the model's decisions more transparent.

#### LIME Explanation Plots (`lime_explanation_[1-3].png`)
- Explains individual predictions
- Shows which features were most important for specific predictions
- Provides both positive and negative contributions
- Helps understand why the model made particular predictions
- Useful for explaining predictions to non-technical stakeholders

### Interpreting the Visualizations

1. **SHAP Summary Plot**:
   - Look for features with wide distributions
   - Red regions indicate higher feature values
   - Blue regions indicate lower feature values
   - The width shows the magnitude of impact

2. **SHAP Dependence Plots**:
   - Vertical spread shows interaction effects
   - Horizontal axis shows feature values
   - Vertical axis shows SHAP values
   - Color indicates another important feature

3. **LIME Explanations**:
   - Green bars show positive contributions
   - Red bars show negative contributions
   - Bar length shows magnitude of impact
   - Feature values are shown in parentheses

### Key Insights from Interpretability

1. **Feature Importance**:
   - Most important features for predictions
   - How features interact with each other
   - Non-linear relationships in the data

2. **Model Behavior**:
   - How the model makes decisions
   - Which features drive predictions
   - Potential biases in the model

3. **Business Value**:
   - Explainable predictions
   - Transparent decision-making
   - Trust in model outputs

### Using Interpretability in Practice
